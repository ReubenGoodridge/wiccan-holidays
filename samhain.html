		    SAMHAIN
		  </h1>

		  <p>
		    Samhain is the Wiccan/Pagan version of Halloween that falls on the same date, October 31st in the Northern Hemisphere and the April 31st in the Southern Hemisphere. The holiday is typically celebrated from the evening of the 31st to the morning of the 1st next month. This time is when the veil between earth and the spirit world (some Wiccans call it Summerland) is thinnest.
		  </p>
        <p class="right">
          A lot of the new or modern halloween traditions are based on the Pagan practices. One such tradition is Trick or Treating which was made to incorporate the aspects of appreciation and compassion that Samhain celebrates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another halloween tradition that is rooted in Pagan practices is pumpkin carving. The scary faces carved into them were supposed to ward off evil spirits walking past and discourage them from walking into your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Samhain is also the time when Wiccans pay respect to their dead friends and family. This can be done by holding a 'Silent Supper' where you set extra places for your passed loved ones and set a photo of them below their plate. Then invite your friends and family over however they must be silent the entire time. Put food on the plates and wine in the cups of the deceased as offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paying your respects to spirits is a common practice during Samhain. This is commonly done by wearing all black and leaving flowers, pumpkins or other offerings on the graves of your family or just outside your door to welcome positive spirits into your space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magick commonly done for Samhain are spells of protection and banishing to remove any excess negative energy so that it does not enter the new year with you as Samhain is the last holiday of the Wiccan year. It is also time to renew your altar space and any magickal tools on it.
