		    Yule
		  </h1>

		  <p>
		    Yule (aka the Winter Solstice) falls on the dates 20-24th of December for the Northern Hemisphere and the 20th-23rd of June for the Southern Hemisphere. This holiday celebrates the shortest day and longest night of the year. Yule tells us that the Sun King (Horned God) is returning and the days will start getting longer. It is the first holiday of the Wiccan year.

        <p class="right">
          Christmas as we know it was traditionally the Pagan version of Yule and so many ways to celebrate are simillar to that of our modern day Christmas. You could decorate pine trees and yule logs or hang a wreath on your door.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decoration of a pine tree (especially hanging food which is now normally small chocolates) is done to welcome positive spirits into your home and to give them a place to stay on cold wintery nights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yule is when Wiccans will plan out the next year, this might remind you of New Year's Resolutions, however it is much more than one or two goals. Wiccans will plan out the spells they want to do over the next year, their herb gardens, write goals for what they want to achieve and plan for warmer days to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating a pine wreath and hanging it on your door is common practice during Yule. The circular shape of the wreath represents the continuos life on earth and how warmth will always return on the Wheel of the Year even after a long, cold winter. Mistletoe may be added which gives the wreath healing and protective properties. After Yule, the Wreath is burried and given back to nature often with a song, dance or spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wiccans will be doing spells of prosperity, new begginings, Yuletide charms and spells for peace and love in the months to come. These spells often involve the use of fire to symbolise the banishment of all the negativity of the past year and the warmth and love in the year that is about to start.
